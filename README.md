# lua-walking-evolution
Neural evolution program to get robots to learn to walk, based on a video by Code Bullet. Written in Lua. Uses LÖVE.

This uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve, using my modified implementation from [LuaNEAT](https://github.com/object-Object/LuaNEAT).

## Included dependencies
I might have modified these. I don't remember. So, they're included in the files.
